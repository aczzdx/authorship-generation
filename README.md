# Authorship Generation

Meet you needs in authorship data cleaning & paragraph generation. 

Given raw data with 'CSV' format, the tool could return a cleaned 'CSV' file and then MS word file with appropriate author order, affiliations and conflict of interest (COI).
## Introduction
This repository generates an open source tool used to create author lists, acknowledgement pages, COI and other necessary supplementary information required by neuroscience journals.
## Installation
Authorship Generation is basically built to use pandas Dataframe and some scikit modules for processing data. Thus, we recommend Anaconda Vitual Environment with Python 3.8 in order to use our tool. 
1. Install the environment supporting for latest python:

    ``` conda install -c anaconda python==3.8```

2. Once creating the Vitual Environment, you could use a simple ``` pip ``` command:

    ```pip install <package name>```

    Python packages are including: 
spacy, ipywidgets, recordlinkage, sklearn, python-docx

Or just run 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Download OpenRefine 3.2 in openrefine.org
## Usage
- For GUI, open GUI.ipynb by jupyter notebook, then run the cells.
- Provide json for regular use, save all your configuations.
## Features
